The Book bar was created by Emma Harte to serve readers worldwide.
Data-driven, the website assists users in finding their next great read; offering both a book upload and recommendation service.
In this way, users can share opinions and knowledge with the greater Book bar community. 

In this project, full CRUD functionality is present. 
Security features are also present. Such include user permissions for the 'admin' user and safe storage of passwords and sensitive-security information.

## UX

### Strategy
The following information was declared during UX research, as part of the 5 plane investigation:

* The website will be created to target book lovers, aged between 15 and 55.
  More specifically, the website aims to target tech-savvy book lovers.

* Only useful, useable, and essential data will be stored in the database.
  E.g., for books, data fields will include the book title, author, a cover image URL, etc.

* In investigating in-scope features for this release, the Importance v Feasibility was studied. Below is a graphic showcasing the results.

### User Stories

#### Visitor stories:
**As an external user**:

1. I want to be able to search for a book by book title or author so that I can find out more information. 

2. I want to be able to search the database by genre so that I can find a suitable book.

3. I want to be able to sort the entire database so that I can view all books.

4. I want to be able to log in or register for an account on the website so that I can access my profile, upload books, and add reviews.

5. I want to see a snapshot of activity on my profile so that I can quickly see my recent contributions.

6. I want to be able to upload a book to the website so that I and others can then review it.

7. I want to be able to make changes or delete a book that I have uploaded, in case an error has been made.

8. I want to be able to review and rate any book on the website so that other users can quickly see what I thought about it.

9. I want to be able to edit and delete reviews that I have added, in case an error has been made.

10. I want to know the average rating for each book, as this will help me choose my next read.

#### Business stories:
**As the website owner**:

1. I want to be able to add new book genres on the website so that users can select these when uploading a book.

2. I want to be able to edit and delete book genres, in case an error has been made.

3. I want to see a snapshot of activity on my profile so that I can quickly see my recent contributions.

4. I want to add a 'Buy now' link to each book so that I can potentially make money off click-through sales.

5. I do not want to allow duplicate book titles to be published, this would lead to a bad customer experience.
 
6. I only want registered users (logged in) to be able to add reviews and books, for monitoring reasons.

7. I want to be able to edit and delete all content created on the website, for monitoring reasons.

### Project Scope
As part of the 5 plane investigation, the project scope was defined.
During this process, the functional and content requirements were examined.
In considering the functional requirements, each problem was examined to find a best-fit solution.
In considering the content requirements, the following were questioned: 
  1. What type of content would fulfill the need (image, video, text, mixed)
  2. Whether or not adequate resources were available to produce the content.

The following is a statement of the defined scope:

#### In scope

* User login and account registration
  - Only if a user is registered and logged in, can the user upload books and add reviews.

* An admin account for the website owner
  - Only with an 'admin' user account, can the user edit & delete all content.
  - This is essential for website management and maintenance.

* A search bar
  - With search bar functionality, a user can find a book suitable to their needs.

* A search by book genre functionality. (nice to have)
  - By adding a search by genre layer, the user experience will be improved
  - A nice to have, not essential but to be considered if time is not an issue.

* Full CRUD functionality.
  - This should be present for all (both 'admin' and non-admin users).
  - The 'admin' user should have full CRUD functionality for all content. 
  - Non-admin users should have full CRUD functionality for the content they have created themselves.
  - The users' actions should be reflected immediately on the front-end.

* Content will be mostly text and imagery
  - As this project is data-focused, less time will be spent on front-end development.

* A 'buy now' link will be added to each new book uploaded.  
  - This will allow the website owner to profit from book sales.

* Users will be able to add books and reviews
  - This is essential in creating a functional book recommendation service 

* A rating functionality will be added as part of each review
  - This is essential in creating a functional book recommendation service 

#### Out of scope

* A sophisticated recommendation algorithm, based on books that have been highly rated by the user.
  - Not possible due to the project time frame, milestone requirements and current skillset.

* A customized dashboard for users. The user will not be shown on their profile: recommendations.
    - Not possible within the current timeframe and due to personal skillset
    - The dashboard will include less sophisticated information such as the user's recent contributions.

* Video banners, striking imagery & dynamic front-end development.
  - As this project is data-focused, less time will be spent on front-end development.

### Wireframes
All wireframes were created using the software [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). 
These layouts were created following research on the five planes of UX, and before coding.\
\
<strong>
Please note, the final website layout contains slight variations to the original wireframes.
Each of the following files contain wireframes for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
</strong>
 
**Users: non-admin**
- [Homepage](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/home.png)
- [Login](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/login.png)
- [Register](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/register.png)
- [Profile](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/profile.png)
- [Add a book](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/addABook.png)
  - The edit book page will be a direct copy of the Add a book page. The fields will be pre-selected.
- [Book page](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/bookPage.png)

**User: admin only**
- [Manage categories](assets/images/readmeFiles/wireframes/manageGenresAdmin.png)
  - The 'add genre' book page will be a direct copy of the Add a book page.
    - It will contain two fields: a genre title and an icon name.
  - The Edit genre page will be a direct copy of the Add genre page. The fields will be pre-selected.

### Design

#### User journey
- The website structure was designed to be consistent, predictable, learnable, visible, and provide user feedback.
- A user journey for non-admin users was created to aid the structural design.

![user journey](assets/images/readmeFiles/userjourney.jpg) 


#### Typography
- All fonts used in this project derive from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). 

- Fonts used include:
  - [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=raleway) - used for h1 - h4
  - [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato?query=lato) - used for h5 - h6 and all other body text


#### Color scheme
- A pink and blue color palette was used in this design.
- Although contrasting, pink is associated with romance and lightness and blue creates a feeling of calmness. Used together, these colors create a positive mood.
- The following color palette was used for inspiration:

### Features Left to Implement
The following are features that were not included in this release. Once adequate time and a developed skillset are available, these points will be revisited.

* Email authentication for account registration
  - Implement email authentication for users who are registering an account. This would be a requirement.

* Admin role creation
  - Create an 'administrator' role, which could be applied to several user accounts.
  - The role would grant users special permissions.
  - Currently, there can be only one 'admin' user, this is the account with the username of 'admin'. Unfortunately, this solution is not scalable.

* Search bar filters & sort by
  - Attempted to implement this at the beginning of the project. The plan was to include a filter for 'category' and a 'sort by' function for results. After several days, I decided to move forward with the project and to leave this feature as a 'nice to have'. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to revisit the task. 

* Add instant verification on the book image, genre icon, and the 'Buy now' URL uploads:
  - With the current setup, no instant verification is available. The user does not know that the link entered is working until the template page has been rendered. 
  - With instant verification, the user would receive feedback before they submit a form.  
  - This would reduce the workload for content moderation and improve the user experience. 

* Update recent Books added/Reviews added section with :
  - With the current setup, no instant verification is available. The user does not know that the link entered is working until the template page has been rendered. 
  - With instant verification, the user would receive feedback before they submit a form.  
  - This would reduce the workload for content moderation and improve the user experience. 

## Information Architecture

### Database information
- MongoDB (a project requirement):
  - This project utilizes MongoDB; a NoSQL database.
  - MongoDB allows users to use unstructured data. This means you can build your application without having to first define the schema.
  - MongoDB was chosen, as this is a requirement for the Milestone Three, code institute project.

- Take-away thoughts:
  - A pre-defined schema would have simplified the development of the overall project.
  - Due to the drawbacks of NoSQL(non-ACID compliance), an SQL database structure would have suited this project better.

### Datatypes
  - The datatypes utilized in this project include the following:
    - ObjectId
    - String
    - Boolean
    - DateTime
    - Array
    - Object
